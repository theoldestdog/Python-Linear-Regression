# Python-Linear-Regression
Initial project using Linear Regression to test model
The model is using the CPI and Consumer Interest Rates w/ CIR as the dependent variable
The correlation is high due to the the CIR being a component in the calc of the CPI but that is expected and helpful for understanding how 
all of the packages hold together
There is a lot of testing and validating the elements of the model throughout the project and the packages used for the testing work as expected.
